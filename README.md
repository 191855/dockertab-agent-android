# DockerTab Agent — Android

Lightweight backend for the DockerTab Android app. Runs on your server and exposes a REST + WebSocket API for monitoring and managing Docker containers from your phone.

No account required. Your phone and your server.

---

## Features

- View all running and stopped containers
- Live CPU, memory, and network stats streamed over WebSocket
- Realtime log tailing, same as `docker logs -f`
- Start, stop, and restart containers from your phone
- Deploy and manage Compose stacks directly from the app
- Run one agent per host, manage all of them from a single app

---

## Quick Start

Clone the repo and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/191855/dockertab-agent-android
cd dockertab-agent-android
make up    # detects your LAN IP, starts the agent
make logs  # QR code prints here
```

Or without cloning, create a `docker-compose.yml` on your server:

```yaml
services:
  dockertab-agent-android:
    image: ghcr.io/191855/dockertab-agent-android:latest
    container_name: dockertab-agent-android
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8378:8378"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - dockertab-config-android:/root/.config/dockertab
    environment:
      - DOCKERTAB_HOST=192.168.1.50   # your server's LAN IP required
      - DOCKERTAB_NAME=Home Server    # shows up in the Android app

volumes:
  dockertab-config-android:
```

Then start it:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f   # QR code prints here
```

**Or with a single `docker run`:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name dockertab-agent-android \
  -p 8378:8378 \
  -e DOCKERTAB_HOST=192.168.1.50 \
  -e DOCKERTAB_NAME="Home Server" \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  -v dockertab-config-android:/root/.config/dockertab \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/191855/dockertab-agent-android:latest
```

## Pairing

Start the agent. A QR code appears in the logs. Open the DockerTab app, tap **Add Server**, and scan it. The app exchanges the API key for a JWT and stores it in Android Keystore via EncryptedSharedPreferences.


---

## Configuration

Two variables are all most setups need: `DOCKERTAB_HOST` (your server's LAN IP, required for the QR code to work) and `DOCKERTAB_NAME` (friendly label shown in the app). Everything else is auto-configured on first run: API key, JWT secret, and port.


---

## Security

- All endpoints except `/healthz` and `/api/v1/pair` require a valid JWT. Tokens expire after 180 days.
- API keys and JWT secrets are generated with `crypto/rand` on first run and stored at `0600`.
- The pairing API key is only accessible via the QR code or the local config file, never returned in HTTP responses.
- The Docker socket is mounted read-only inside the container.
- Environment variable values matching common secret patterns (PASSWORD, TOKEN, KEY, etc.) are redacted in the `/env` endpoint response.

---

## Keeping Secrets Across Rebuilds

On first start the agent generates a random API key and JWT secret and writes them to disk. Mount the `dockertab-config` volume and they'll survive rebuilds. Without it, they regenerate on every rebuild and break existing pairings.

If you'd rather skip the volume, just set `DOCKERTAB_API_KEY` and `DOCKERTAB_JWT_SECRET` to fixed values in your compose file.

> **Note:** Up, Down, Pull, and Logs require the `docker` CLI to be available in the agent container — it is included from v2.0 onwards.

## Compose Stack Files

Stacks deployed through the app are stored on the agent host at:

```
~/.config/dockertab-android/compose/<stack-name>/docker-compose.yml
```

This directory is persisted via the `dockertab-config-android` volume. Stacks started outside the app (discovered from running containers) are read-only — their compose files are not managed by the agent.

---

## Push Notifications & Remote Access

Push notifications and remote access (outside your home network) are **DockerTab Premium** features, powered by the DockerTab relay — operated by DockerTab.

The agent maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to the relay. This serves two purposes:

- **Push notifications** — container start, stop, and restart events are forwarded to FCM and delivered to your Android device, even when you're away from home.
- **Remote access** — when your phone is outside your LAN, the relay proxies API requests to your agent so you can manage containers from anywhere without exposing your server to the internet.

**Privacy:** The relay is stateless. It forwards requests and notification payloads without storing or retaining any data. Only the minimum information needed to deliver a notification (container name, action, agent ID) is ever transmitted — no logs, no environment variables, no sensitive data.

---

## Troubleshooting

**QR code shows `0.0.0.0`**: set `DOCKERTAB_HOST` to your server's LAN IP.

**App can't connect after scanning**: make sure your phone and server are on the same network and port 8378 isn't blocked by a firewall.

**`permission denied` on Docker socket**: if you're running outside Docker Compose, add your user to the `docker` group or check the socket path.

**Pairing fails after a rebuild**: without a config volume, the API key regenerates on every rebuild. Either mount `dockertab-config-android` or set `DOCKERTAB_API_KEY` to a fixed value.

**WebSocket drops immediately**: if you're behind nginx, add `proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade` and `proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"`.
